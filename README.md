### Replace your boring digital clock with interesting quotes from literature that draw your attention while also telling you what time it is. 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


## How to use:

<br>Install Rainmeter from <a href="https://www.rainmeter.net/" target="_blank"><u>here</u></a>
<br>Download this code as a zip file
<br>Extract the zip file and copy the contents to your Rainmeter/Skins/ folder
<br>Go to rainmeter and load the litclock.ini file

#### If the font seems too large/small click the 'Edit' option in Rainmeter and increase/desrease the 'Scale' variable and see the changes.
That's it. Enjoy! <br>
