### Replace your boring digital clock with interesting quotes from literature that draw your attention while also telling you what time it is. What's more, it also changes color based on your desktop background!

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


## How to use:

<br>Install Rainmeter from <a href="https://www.rainmeter.net/" target="_blank"><u>here</u></a>
<br>Download this github repo as a zip file
<br>Extract the zip file and copy the contents to your Rainmeter/Skins/ folder
<br>Go to rainmeter and load the litclock.ini file

#### If the font seems too large/small click the 'Edit' option in Rainmeter and increase/desrease the 'Scale' variable and see the changes.
That's it. Enjoy! <br>

I have borrowed some resources from:

P.S. This is my very first project for Rainmeter as well as in Lua so feel free to suggest any improvements! :)
