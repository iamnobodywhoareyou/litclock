## How to use: <br>

Install Rainmeter from https://www.rainmeter.net/ <br>
Download as a zip file <br>
Extract the zip file and copy the contents to your Rainmeter/Skins/ folder <br>
Go to rainmeter and load the litclock.ini file <br>

If the font seems too large/small click the 'Edit' option in Rainmeter and increase/desrease the 'Scale' variable and see the changes. <br>
That's it. Enjoy! <br>
